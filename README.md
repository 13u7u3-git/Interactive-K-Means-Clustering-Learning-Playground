# Interactive-K-Means-Clustering-Learning Playground (Colab)

An **interactive K-Means clustering playground** built for Google Colab.  
You can experiment with arbitrary points and centroids and step through K-Means iterations visually.

## Features
- Preloaded example points and centroids for immediate practice.
- Step through K-Means iterations with "Next Iteration".
- Reset to try different configurations.
- Fully Colab-compatible, no installation needed.

## Usage
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab:
   [notebooks/kmeans_playground_colab.ipynb](notebooks/kmeans_playground_colab.ipynb)
2. Edit the point and centroid coordinates (optional).
3. Click **Apply Positions** to display points and centroids.
4. Click **Next Iteration** to perform a K-Means step.
5. Click **Reset** to start over.
